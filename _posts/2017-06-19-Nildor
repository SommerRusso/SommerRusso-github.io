Capital City: Seawake

Flag: Silver stallion on emerald

Motto: Adversa Virtute Repelle {Repel Adversity by Valor}

Rulers: King Alexander (43) and Queen Charlotte (35)

Royal Children: The royal couple has give up hope of children as the Queen was discovered to be barren one year ago.

Royal Residence: Seawake Castle - a large castle situated on a hill that overlooks a seaside town of the same name.

Means of Ascension: Nildor's laws state that a King and Queen must explicitly name an heir in their will - similar to the practice of the first emperors of Rome - in order to ensure a peaceful transfer of power to the most worthy candidate. Shay Firetongue, on his 20th birthday, was officially written into King Alexander and Queen Charlotte's will in this capacity.
